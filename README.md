As for docuentation issues –

Same goes for documentation. I see more bitching and entitlement around quality documentation than any other issue. You are not entitled to good (or any) documentation. If you don’t have the time to read the code, the tests, and the examples, shut up or fuck off. I don’t have the time to explain shit to you. I document my work for my own needs. I publish a lot of code without any documentation. Don’t ask me to add some. The only right thing to do is to ask if I am willing to take a pull request adding or improving the documentation. That’s it.

If you don’t pay me for my services or contribute meaningful value to me personally, I don’t owe you shit. You are not my customer and you are rarely right. Open source is not an invitation for harassment and making demands. If you choose to interact with me about my open source work, remember it was your decision and you can stop interacting with me at any time. No one is forcing you to use my code. I am giving you a lot of free modules to do with as you wish. That license does not extend to my time or my attention.
